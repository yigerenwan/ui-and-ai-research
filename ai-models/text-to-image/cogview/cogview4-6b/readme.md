# CogView4-6B

## Quick Start

First, ensure you install the diffusers library from source.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

Then, run the following code:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import CogView4Pipeline

pipe = CogView4Pipeline.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogView4-6B", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

# Open it for reduce GPU memory usage
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()

prompt = "A vibrant cherry red sports car sits proudly under the gleaming sun, its polished exterior smooth and flawless, casting a mirror-like reflection. The car features a low, aerodynamic body, angular headlights that gaze forward like predatory eyes, and a set of black, high-gloss racing rims that contrast starkly with the red. A subtle hint of chrome embellishes the grille and exhaust, while the tinted windows suggest a luxurious and private interior. The scene conveys a sense of speed and elegance, the car appearing as if it's about to burst into a sprint along a coastal road, with the ocean's azure waves crashing in the background."
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    guidance_scale=3.5,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    width=1024,
    height=1024,
).images[0]

image.save("cogview4.png")
```

For cogview4.py, run

```bash
streamlit run cogview4.py --server.address localhost
```
